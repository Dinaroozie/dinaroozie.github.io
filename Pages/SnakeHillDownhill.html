<p>Snake Hill Downhill is a kind of silly game I've been working on on and off for a couple of months. I'm not planning on selling it unless something surprising happens - it's more of a game jam kind of a project.</p>

<h1>The Comfort Zone Game Jam</h1>

<p> This was the result of a bit of a funk me and some friends/colleagues had fallen into as a result of covid shenanigans (teaching from home sucks, by the way). We wanted to just make something and get it shipped in a fairly small period of time. But, we didn't want to add to our stresses, so we invented the Comfort Zone Jam. Our goal was to make a game that <em>we could already make.</em> No new skills. We're not setting out to make something in a new engine, or learn some new technology or technique, we're just making a game that falls pretty squarely in our existing skillsets.</p>

<p>For me, that means C++, OpenGL, 2D game, maybe some fancy shader stuff but visually abstract, physics-based gameplay. Basically, similar to Colour Bind, but with (hopefully) a bit more gamedev experience under my belt than last time.<p>

<p>More information will be here at some point in the future. Maybe. I shouldn't promise.</p>
