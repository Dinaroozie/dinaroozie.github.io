Look, I know I'm a games programmer, but that doesn't mean I know much of anything about web tech. So, I'm learning, it's a work in progress, and you'll find very little of interest here (and some horribly old school web design while I learn how things work from the ground up). You don't have to like it. <em>It's what you get.</em>
